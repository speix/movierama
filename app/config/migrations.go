Instead, he finds a squat, to explore, as he puts it, \"free love and dope\". In October 1974, Gerry happens to gain entry to a prostitute's flat and he steals the Â£700 he finds there and chats briefly with a man sitting in a park. On that evening in Guildford, southwest of London, there is an explosion at a pub that kills four off-duty soldiers and a civilian, and wounds sixty-five others.",
